Our calculator has the function to be a classic calculator as a vertical orientation and a scientific calculator 
when it is at a horizontal orientation.

Our Main Activity, has  our fields that correlate to buttons on XML. We also have a method that evaluates our XML button inputs. 
Our Main Activity, also evaluates a conditional that looks for a clicker selecting our inverse button and it will work appropriately.

We also incorporated our ExtendedDoubleEvaluator class that extends from the Javaluator libraries' Double Evaluator class. We inputed 
factorial and sqrt operators to give functions to these buttons on XML.

Our other buttons receive their functions from the Double Evaluator class, taken rom the Javaluator library.

We have implemented the Javaluator library into our dependency in our gradle.
